# Woo Portal

The Woo Portal is a website that allows people with a Metamask Wallet (connected to the Rinkeby Testnet) to send messages as transactions in the blockchain.

## Features

Woo: You can send a "Woo" with a message, that will be transacted on the blockchain. Then, it will appear at the homepage as a card, showing the timestamp, message, and sender address.
Woo Back: You can "answer" a "Woo" with a "Woo Back", which will sum to the Woo Back counter that appears at the card.

## Smart Contract

The smart contract behind the features can be checked at the following repository:
https://github.com/MarcosGaius/woo-project-smart-contract

## To do's

Add an "About" section in the header.
Add an input to filter and sort cards.
Add the total "Woo" counter at the homepage.

## Notes

I look forward to improve this project as I learn more. The fact I used react.js in this project gave me some limitations as many features relies on my study. Given that, I'm studying react.js to add new features to the site.
